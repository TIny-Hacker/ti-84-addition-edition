# TI-84 Addition Edition
### Turn your TI-84 Plus CE into the legendary TI-83 Plus Addition Edition. (Now with color!)

This program will disable all keys other than <kbd>0</kbd>-<kbd>9</kbd>, <kbd>enter</kbd>, and <kbd>+</kbd> to give you an experience as close as possible to the TI-83 Plus Addition Edition. For best results, use this without a shell installed on your calculator.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release and send both **ADDSETUP.8xp** and **AdEdHook.8xv** to your calculator.
2. Run **ADDSETUP** from the <kbd>prgm</kbd> menu.

## Usage

After running **ADDSETUP**, you should now have the functionality of the Addition Edition directly on your TI-84 Plus CE! If you wish to revoke this power, pressing the <kbd>on</kbd> key will bring your calculator back to normal. Running this program through a shell may cause the installation to fail (or other unwanted results), so running from the homescreen is the safest way to ensure everything goes according to plan.  

Enjoy!
